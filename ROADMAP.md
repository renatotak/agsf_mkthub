## Architectural North Star (locked 2026-04-06)

The platform exists to support analyses around **5 core nodes**. Every feature, every table, every scraper must contribute data that resolves to one or more of them. **Canonical reference: `docs/ENTITY_MODEL.md`.**

| # | Node | Identity | Multi-stakeholder model |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Legal Entity** | `entity_uid` + `tax_id` (CPF or CNPJ) | `entity_roles` junction (one CNPJ can be retailer + producer + client at once) |
| 2 | **Farm** | `farm_uid` (CAR/INCRA/centroid) | `farm_ownership` junction (multi-shareholder, mixing CPFs and CNPJs) |
| 3 | **Asset** | `asset_uid` (CPR/loan/note/insurance) | `asset_parties` junction (borrower / lender / guarantor / beneficiary) |
| 4 | **Commercial Activity** | `activity_uid` (sale/barter/trade) | retailer + buyer + farm + product (single-FK each) |
| 5 | **AgriSafe Service** | `service_uid` | `client_group_uid` (always a Group, even of size 1) + polymorphic `service_targets` (farm | entity | group | asset) |

**Cross-cutting:** `groups`, `group_members`, `entity_mentions` (junction for news / regulations / events).

**Implementation rule:** algorithms first, LLMs last. LLMs are reserved for prose generation, conversational interfaces, and last-resort fuzzy matching. See CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for full details.

---

## Phase 17 — Five Core Nodes Foundation ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-06)

The foundational schema phase that everything else hangs off. Database is now reorganized around the 5 core nodes from `docs/ENTITY_MODEL.md`. Shipped in **6 commits across 6 sub-phases**, all pushed to `origin/main`.

| Sub-phase | Commit | Migration(s) | What |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------|
| **17A** | `733f674` | 018, 019 | 12 new tables: 5 core nodes (`legal_entities`, `farms`, `assets`, `commercial_activities`, `agrisafe_service_contracts`) + 7 junction/support tables (`entity_roles`, `groups`, `group_members`, `farm_ownership`, `asset_parties`, `agrisafe_service_targets`, `entity_mentions`). RLS + confidentiality on every table, 15 FK constraints. |
| **17B** | `b75f7d8` | 020–023 | Backfill **9,433 legal_entities** (9,328 retailers + 80 RJ-only + 18 industries + 7 competitors) and **9,353 entity_roles** assignments. Re-key 5 satellite tables to `entity_uid` (100% link rate). Add `confidentiality` enum to 25 more tables (16 public / 6 agrisafe_published / 3 agrisafe_confidential). Rebuild `v_retailer_profile`, `v_retailers_in_rj`, plus new canonical `v_entity_profile` (one-row entity lookup). All views use `security_invoker=on`. |
| **17C** | `f374b17` | 024 | Add `retailers.entity_uid` FK + backfill (9,328/9,328). New helper `src/lib/entities.ts#ensureLegalEntityUid` (idempotent, race-safe). Wire it into write APIs (`/api/company-enrichment`, `/api/company-notes`, `/api/company-research`) so every new row carries `entity_uid`. |
| **17D** | `08dc7c4` | 025 | Backfill `entity_mentions` from RJ (118 mentions, subject/negative). New algorithm-first matcher `src/lib/entity-matcher.ts` with Portuguese-agro stopword blocklist + multi-word/length-10 rule. Wire matcher into `sync-agro-news` and `sync-recuperacao-judicial` crons. **Initial backfill: 2 true-positive news mentions, zero false positives** (CAPAL COOPERATIVA, SPAÇO AGRÍCOLA). |
| **17E** | `21b39f7` | — | `/api/retailer-intelligence` accepts `entity_uid` (preferred) or `cnpj_raiz` (fallback). News lookup REPLACED: was an ILIKE substring scan over `agro_news` (lossy, accent-blind, slow at scale), now a deterministic JOIN through `entity_mentions`. UI panel propagates entity_uid. |
| **17F** | `22bd422` | 026 | Add `recuperacao_judicial.entity_uid` FK + backfill (118/118). Mirrors mig 024. Existing `select("*")` in the UI auto-carries entity_uid for any future drill-down — no UI changes needed. |

**End-state numbers:**
- 31 tables (was 22), 26 migrations (was 17)
- 9,433 legal_entities, 9,353 entity_roles, 120 entity_mentions
- All 9,328 retailers + all 118 RJ rows linked to a canonical entity
- `get_advisors`: 0 ERRORs, only the same pre-existing WARNs as before Phase 17

**Architectural payoffs unlocked for Phase 18+:**
- Anything that mentions a CNPJ now resolves to a single `entity_uid` — drill-downs across modules trivialize.
- Cross-cutting graph queries: *"show me all news mentioning the entities currently in RJ"* is one JOIN.
- Confidentiality tier in place at row level on 31 tables — RAG/chat in Phase 28 can filter by user role.
- Reusable algorithm-first entity matcher (`src/lib/entity-matcher.ts`) ready for events / regulations / industries crons when those get wired.

**Cleanup deferred (low priority, do alongside Phase 24):**
- Drop legacy `cnpj_raiz` / `cnpj_basico` text columns once nothing reads them
- Wire entity-matcher into `sync-events-na`, `sync-regulatory`, `archive-old-news`
- Refresh `KnowledgeMindMap.tsx` "current state" view — the future-state nodes shown there are now real, not aspirational
- Migrate the remaining cnpj_raiz reads in `RetailersDirectory.tsx`, `RegulatoryFramework.tsx`, `RecuperacaoJudicial.tsx`, `CompetitorRadar.tsx` to entity_uid

## Phase 18 — Painel (Dashboard) Improvements

From `docs/TODO_2026-04-06.md`:

- [x] First-row KPI buttons open a **modal** highlighting what's important in each chapter, with a CTA button linking to the chapter ✅
- [x] **Mapa de Inteligência Integrada** — natively parse location for every news, event, and weather record so they can all be plotted on the map ✅
- [x] Map filter by **date range** (next 30d / next 90d) for events ✅
- [x] Notícias in Painel pipe into the **Knowledge Base** (RAG ingestion) ✅
- [/] Add new news sources via **LLM agents** (Claude tasks, Grok tasks) running on cloud, controlled by user from desktop (Foundation in `sync-llm-intel`)
- [x] **Webapp version** of the whole app with a **chat feature** so the user can talk to an agent that pulls from the knowledge base (RAG implemented in `OracleChat.tsx`) ✅

---

## Phase 19 — Pulso do Mercado: Macro Context Layer

The current Pulso do Mercado covers daily prices and futures. The user wants higher-latency macro data layered in, from official agencies — and the user explicitly raised that scrapers need to be well organized with a knowledge base / auto-correction protocol when sources change. So Phase 19 ships in two prongs: a resilience foundation (19A), then macro scrapers built on top of it (19B).

### Phase 19A — Scraper Resilience Foundation ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-07)

The pre-Phase-19 cron pipeline only used `logSync()` (a flat per-run pass/fail row in `sync_logs`) — no schema validation, no per-source health, no narrative memory of past failures. Adding 6 macro scrapers on top of that would compound the debt. This phase establishes the protocol every new scraper must follow.

- [x] **Migration 027** — `scraper_registry`, `scraper_runs`, `scraper_knowledge` (3 tables, RLS enabled, deterministic schema_check JSONB)
- [x] **`src/lib/scraper-runner.ts`** — `runScraper()` wrapper. Validates output rows against the registered schema (required keys + types + numeric ranges + enum values + row count), updates the registry's health (cadence-aware grace period: degraded after 1 failure beyond grace, broken after 3 consecutive), writes a `scraper_knowledge` row of kind=`failure` on every failure, and calls `logSync()` internally for backward compat with the DataSources UI. **Validation is 100% deterministic — no LLM in the loop (guardrail #1).**
- [x] **`docs/SCRAPER_PROTOCOL.md`** — documents the 4-phase auto-correction loop (detection → diagnosis → fix → validation), explicitly **human-driven** (LLMs may propose fixes in chat sessions, but the actual fix must be reviewed and committed by a human)
- [x] **`/api/cron/sync-scraper-healthcheck`** — no-op smoke test that pings `api.github.com/zen` to validate the wiring end-to-end. Wired into `sync-all`. Safe to delete after Phase 19B has been green for 2+ weeks.

### Phase 19B — Macro Context First Slice (FAOSTAT) ✅ PARTIAL (2026-04-07)

- [x] Register 6 key macro sources (USDA, FAO, OECD, MDIC, CONAB, World Bank) in `source-registry.json`
- [x] **Migration 028** — create `macro_statistics` table (was wrongly claimed as "Migration 018" in the previous draft of this roadmap; that migration is actually `entity_model_core.sql` from Phase 17A). Includes guardrail #2 carve-out comment: macro statistics are commodity-dimension aggregates with no entity FK by design. Migration also seeds the `sync-faostat-prod` row in `scraper_registry`.
- [x] **`/api/cron/sync-faostat`** — TS scraper for FAOSTAT v1 REST (`fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/api/v1/en/data/QCL`). Pulls last 5 years of crop production + export quantity for soybeans and maize across World / Brazil / Argentina / USA / China. Algorithmic FAOSTAT code → commodity slug mapping in `src/lib/macro/faostat-codes.ts`. Built on `runScraper()`. Wired into `sync-all`.
- [x] **`/api/macro-stats`** — public read endpoint, ISR cached 1h, returns rows + `last_success_at` from `scraper_registry` so the UI can show MockBadge when data is stale (>2x cadence)
- [x] **MarketPulse → Contexto Macro sub-tab** — `MacroAnalysis` component now fetches FAOSTAT data live from `/api/macro-stats` for soja and milho, pivots long-format rows into the existing wide chart shape, shows a "Live data" pulse badge when fresh, falls back to mock + MockBadge for cultures FAOSTAT doesn't cover (café, boi-gordo, trigo, algodão) or when stale. Source provenance footer shows the FAOSTAT `last_success_at` date.
- [x] **Bilingual i18n** — `marketPulse.macroLiveBadge`, `macroSourceFootnote`, `macroNoData`, `macroNeverFetched` added to `src/lib/i18n.ts` (PT-BR + EN)
- [x] **Deprecate** `src/scripts/scrape_macro.py` (USDA WASDE Python draft) — header comment, kept as reference, not deleted
- [ ] **OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook** scraper → world supply, demand, price projections
- [ ] **USDA WASDE** monthly reports → US/world S&D estimates (port the Python draft once `scraper_knowledge` has accumulated lessons from FAOSTAT)
- [ ] **MDIC ComexStat** scraper → Brazilian export volumes/values by HS code
- [ ] **CONAB safra** monthly reports → Brazilian production by state and crop
- [ ] **World Bank Pink Sheet** → monthly commodity price index (XLSX, fragile — keep for after WASDE)
- [ ] FAOSTAT coverage extensions: coffee, cotton, sugar, wheat (current slice covers soybean + maize only)

---

## Phase 20 — Inteligência de Insumos Build-Out

The current `AgInputIntelligence.tsx` is a wrapper around AGROFIT/Bioinsumos search. The user wants this to become an **oracle** for ag-input substitution.

- [ ] **Federal source**: full AGROFIT registered products list (defensives + fertilizers + biologicals)
- [ ] **State sources**: per-state agriculture secretariat lists (each `secretaria de agricultura` publishes its own approved list)
- [ ] Database schema: `active_ingredients` ↔ `commercial_brands` ↔ `manufacturers (companies)` — proper FK to the `companies` table
- [ ] First-batch scraper for the federal AGROFIT list, then state lists in priority order (MT, MS, GO, PR, RS, SP, MG, BA)
- [ ] **Oracle UX**: user enters a culture + region → app suggests cheaper alternatives to patented products commonly used by producers in that region. Shows molecule equivalence, brand alternatives, price range.
- [ ] Source registry entries for all the public ag-input lists

---

## Phase 21 — Radar Competitivo: CRUD + Web Enrichment

- [ ] **Modal with CRUD** — add/edit/delete competitors directly from the UI
- [ ] Each company supports **manual notes** + **automatic web search** enrichment
- [ ] Anchor competitors to the canonical `companies` table via `cnpj_basico`
- [ ] Optional Harvey Ball comparison matrix (vertical, depth, precision, pulse, regulatory, UX)

---

## Phase 22 — Notícias Agro: CRUD + Reading-Room Integration

- [ ] **Modal/list with CRUD** for news providers (currently 5 RSS feeds, hardcoded)
- [ ] Connect the existing **reading-room Chrome extension** (`C:\Users\renat\.gemini\antigravity\projects\1 personal\reading-room`) to push articles into Supabase instead of localhost
- [ ] More source detail: provider name, RSS URL, last fetch, error count
- [ ] Article entity-mention parser: when ingesting an article, scan for known CNPJs / cidades / culturas and write to `entity_mentions`

---

## Phase 23 — Eventos Agro: Missing Sources + Source Detail + AI Enrichment

- [ ] Scrape and ingest events from:
  - https://baldebranco.com.br/confira-os-grandes-eventos-do-agro-em-2026/
  - https://agroadvance.com.br/blog-feiras-e-eventos-agro-2026/
- [ ] Show **source provenance** on every event card
- [ ] Button to let an agent **enrich event details** from the event's website (algorithmic first, LLM only for the prose summary)
- [ ] Schema additions: `events.organizer_cnpj` (FK to companies), `events.location_lat/lng`
- [ ] **App Campo integration** — events feed becomes the calendar source for the AgriSafe field-sales mobile app

---

## Phase 24 — Diretório de Canais → CRM Tool

The current Diretório de Canais shows retailers from a static Excel import. The user wants it to become AgriSafe's **CRM**.

- [ ] **Split out Industries** into a new chapter `Diretório de Indústrias` with the same UX as channels
- [ ] **New main indicators row** (4 cards):
  1. Total Channels + horizontal bar chart by category
  2. Cities with channels + concentration in top cities (bar chart)
  3. Channels in Recuperação Judicial → modal with all distress data
  4. Channels appearing in any news portal → modal with company / portal / publication date
- [ ] **Highlights**:
  - Companies in Recuperação Judicial (already done — `RiskSignals.tsx`)
  - Companies **expanding operations** — query Receita Federal (`crawlers.cnpj_estabelecimentos`) for recently opened CNPJs in agribusiness CNAEs by region
  - Companies mentioned in main news portals (NA, Agribiz, neofeed, Bloomberg Línea/agro, Globo Rural, etc.)
- [ ] **Per-company enrichment**:
  - Inpev cross-reference (defensive container recycling membership)
  - Google Maps Street View / Places photo of the POS
  - AgriSafe data imported from OneNote meeting files
  - Key persons, interests, meeting history, lead status
- [ ] **3-tier confidentiality model** enforced via the new `confidentiality` enum
- [ ] **Knowledge Base integration** — chat / RAG queries respect tier permissions
- [ ] **CRM workflow**: schedule meetings, find leads, push leads to **Central de Conteúdo** for newsletter / WhatsApp / email outreach

---

## Phase 25 — Marco Regulatório: Manual Inserts + Source CRUD

- [ ] Button to **upload a new law / regulation** (PDF or text) and add it to `regulatory_norms`
- [ ] Modal listing all main legal sources with CRUD
- [ ] When a norm is inserted, run an algorithmic CNAE classifier to populate `affected_companies`

---

## Phase 26 — Recuperação Judicial: Easier Backfilling + Debt Scraping

- [ ] **Easy CNPJ insertion** — paste a CNPJ, fetch Receita Federal, classify CNAE, insert into `recuperacao_judicial` if not present
- [ ] **Debt amount scraper** — for each RJ case, scrape the judicial process page (e-SAJ / TJ portals) OR run a DuckDuckGo / Google search and let an algorithmic regex pull "R$ X milhões" from snippets. LLM only as last-resort summarizer.
- [ ] Backfill the missing companies the user has flagged

---

## Phase 27 — Ingestão de Dados: Source CRUD + Usage Visibility

- [ ] CRUD for sources in the Source Registry UI
- [ ] **Usage map**: which Supabase tables each source feeds (visual graph)
- [ ] **Health tracking**: last successful fetch, error count, latency, sample row count
- [ ] Per-source enable/disable toggle (writes to `source_registry.active`)

---

## Phase 28 — Knowledge Architecture & RAG Foundation (carryover from old Phase 16)

- [x] 4-tier knowledge architecture (already enforced via `knowledge_items.tier`)
- [x] pgvector enabled
- [x] `news_knowledge` table with embeddings
- [x] Knowledge Base module with semantic search
- [x] Knowledge Mind Map visualization
- [ ] **MCP server** that exposes the knowledge base to Claude / GPT / other LLM agents
- [ ] **RAG endpoint** with confidentiality-tier-aware filtering
- [ ] Daily executive briefing generated from the knowledge base
- [ ] Anomaly narratives when MarketPulse detects rupture

---

## Phase 29 — AI Integration & Virtual Coworker (carryover from old Phase 17)

- [ ] OpenAI / Gemini / Claude content generation for first-draft articles from the topic pipeline
- [ ] Conversational chat interface (chat-style knowledge query) with RAG + tier permissions
- [ ] **Webapp version** of the entire app — same UI but web-only, with the chat panel always available
- [ ] Cron-driven LLM agents that scan news/events for entity mentions and enrich the knowledge base

---

## Phase 30 — Cross-Platform Intelligence & Polish

- [ ] Cross-reference RJ entities with Admin Portal via CNPJ
- [ ] Commodity exposure alerts in Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Market context panel when commercial team views a prospect
- [ ] Sentry error monitoring
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Ctrl+K command palette
- [ ] CSV/PDF export per module
- [ ] Institutional PDF export (executive briefing format)

## Strategic Vision

Market Hub is **not just a dashboard** — it is the knowledge engine of the AgriSafe ecosystem:

1. **Data is ingested** algorithmically from public sources (~166 catalogued, ~120 active) — **no LLM scraping**
2. **Knowledge is organized** around the 5 core entities (company, rural producer, farm, financial operation, ag-input transaction) and the 4 confidentiality tiers (public, agrisafe_published, agrisafe_confidential, client_confidential)
3. **Insights are generated** by cross-referencing entities (e.g. `v_retailers_in_rj` revealed R$ 582.6M of distressed channels in the Diretório)
4. **Content is created** — LinkedIn articles, campaigns, positioning — feeding back into the AgriSafe brand
5. **The brain is built** — RAG structure that becomes AgriSafe's digital twin, accessible via a webapp chat interface

The platform serves multiple AgriSafe products downstream:
- **Admin Portal** — credit risk, commercial intelligence
- **App Campo** — field sales agenda, client visits, calendar from Eventos Agro
- **Newsletter / WhatsApp outreach** — driven by Central de Conteúdo + CRM leads from Diretório de Canais
