## Architectural North Star (added 2026-04-06)

The platform exists to support analyses around **5 core entities**. Every feature, every table, every scraper must contribute data that resolves to one or more of these:

1. **Company** — `cnpj_basico` (industry, retailer, cooperative, frigorífico, trader)
2. **Rural producer** — `cpf_or_cnpj`
3. **Farm** — `farm_uid` (CAR / INCRA / geo-centroid)
4. **Financial operation** — `op_uid` (CPR, loan, insurance, barter)
5. **Ag-input transaction** — `tx_uid`

**Implementation rule:** algorithms first, LLMs last. LLMs are reserved for prose generation, conversational interfaces, and last-resort fuzzy matching. See CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for full details.

## Phase 17 — Five Core Entities Foundation 🎯 NEXT

This is the **foundational schema phase** that everything else hangs off. Before building Phase 18+ features, the database must be reorganized around the 5 core entities.

- [ ] **Migration 018**: Create canonical entity tables
  - `companies(cnpj_basico PK, razao_social, ...)` — replaces ad-hoc retailer/industry/RJ joins
  - `rural_producers(cpf_or_cnpj PK, name, type, ...)`
  - `farms(farm_uid PK, car_code, incra_code, lat, lng, area_ha, ...)`
  - `financial_operations(op_uid PK, type, amount, currency, start_date, end_date, ...)`
  - `agro_input_transactions(tx_uid PK, retailer_cnpj, producer_id, farm_uid, product_id, ...)`
- [ ] **Migration 019**: Backfill `companies` from existing `retailers`, `industries`, `recuperacao_judicial`, `competitors` tables
- [ ] **Migration 020**: Junction table `entity_mentions(entity_type, entity_id, source_table, source_id)` so news, regulations, and events can link to multiple entities
- [ ] **Migration 021**: Add `confidentiality` enum column to all tables that may store proprietary data (`public`, `agrisafe_published`, `agrisafe_confidential`)
- [ ] **Migration 022**: Update `v_retailers_in_rj` and other views to use the new `companies` table
- [ ] Update RetailersDirectory, RegulatoryFramework, RecuperacaoJudicial, CompetitorRadar to read from the canonical entity tables
- [ ] Document the new schema in `docs/ENTITY_MODEL.md`

---

## Phase 18 — Painel (Dashboard) Improvements

From `docs/TODO_2026-04-06.md`:

- [ ] First-row KPI buttons open a **modal** highlighting what's important in each chapter, with a CTA button linking to the chapter
- [ ] **Mapa de Inteligência Integrada** — natively parse location for every news, event, and weather record so they can all be plotted on the map
- [ ] Map filter by **date range** (next 30d / next 90d) for events
- [ ] Notícias in Painel pipe into the **Knowledge Base** (RAG ingestion)
- [ ] Add new news sources via **LLM agents** (Claude tasks, Grok tasks) running on cloud, controlled by user from desktop
- [ ] **Webapp version** of the whole app with a **chat feature** so the user can talk to an agent that pulls from the knowledge base (RAG + MCP server)

---

## Phase 19 — Pulso do Mercado: Macro Context Layer

The current Pulso do Mercado covers daily prices and futures. The user wants higher-latency macro data layered in, from official agencies.

- [ ] **OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook** scraper → world supply, demand, price projections
- [ ] **FAO FAOSTAT** scraper → world production by commodity and country
- [ ] **USDA WASDE** monthly reports → US/world S&D estimates
- [ ] **MDIC ComexStat** scraper → Brazilian export volumes/values by HS code
- [ ] **CONAB safra** monthly reports → Brazilian production by state and crop
- [ ] **World Bank Pink Sheet** → monthly commodity price index
- [ ] Update `source-registry.json` and `Ingestão de Dados` to reflect these new sources
- [ ] Region map: filter follows the **main culture filter** (already done: CommodityMap controlled by parent)
- [ ] New "Macro Context" sub-tab in Pulso do Mercado showing exports volume, BR production, world production, projection vs actual

---

## Phase 20 — Inteligência de Insumos Build-Out

The current `AgInputIntelligence.tsx` is a wrapper around AGROFIT/Bioinsumos search. The user wants this to become an **oracle** for ag-input substitution.

- [ ] **Federal source**: full AGROFIT registered products list (defensives + fertilizers + biologicals)
- [ ] **State sources**: per-state agriculture secretariat lists (each `secretaria de agricultura` publishes its own approved list)
- [ ] Database schema: `active_ingredients` ↔ `commercial_brands` ↔ `manufacturers (companies)` — proper FK to the `companies` table
- [ ] First-batch scraper for the federal AGROFIT list, then state lists in priority order (MT, MS, GO, PR, RS, SP, MG, BA)
- [ ] **Oracle UX**: user enters a culture + region → app suggests cheaper alternatives to patented products commonly used by producers in that region. Shows molecule equivalence, brand alternatives, price range.
- [ ] Source registry entries for all the public ag-input lists

---

## Phase 21 — Radar Competitivo: CRUD + Web Enrichment

- [ ] **Modal with CRUD** — add/edit/delete competitors directly from the UI
- [ ] Each company supports **manual notes** + **automatic web search** enrichment
- [ ] Anchor competitors to the canonical `companies` table via `cnpj_basico`
- [ ] Optional Harvey Ball comparison matrix (vertical, depth, precision, pulse, regulatory, UX)

---

## Phase 22 — Notícias Agro: CRUD + Reading-Room Integration

- [ ] **Modal/list with CRUD** for news providers (currently 5 RSS feeds, hardcoded)
- [ ] Connect the existing **reading-room Chrome extension** (`C:\Users\renat\.gemini\antigravity\projects\1 personal\reading-room`) to push articles into Supabase instead of localhost
- [ ] More source detail: provider name, RSS URL, last fetch, error count
- [ ] Article entity-mention parser: when ingesting an article, scan for known CNPJs / cidades / culturas and write to `entity_mentions`

---

## Phase 23 — Eventos Agro: Missing Sources + Source Detail + AI Enrichment

- [ ] Scrape and ingest events from:
  - https://baldebranco.com.br/confira-os-grandes-eventos-do-agro-em-2026/
  - https://agroadvance.com.br/blog-feiras-e-eventos-agro-2026/
- [ ] Show **source provenance** on every event card
- [ ] Button to let an agent **enrich event details** from the event's website (algorithmic first, LLM only for the prose summary)
- [ ] Schema additions: `events.organizer_cnpj` (FK to companies), `events.location_lat/lng`
- [ ] **App Campo integration** — events feed becomes the calendar source for the AgriSafe field-sales mobile app

---

## Phase 24 — Diretório de Canais → CRM Tool

The current Diretório de Canais shows retailers from a static Excel import. The user wants it to become AgriSafe's **CRM**.

- [ ] **Split out Industries** into a new chapter `Diretório de Indústrias` with the same UX as channels
- [ ] **New main indicators row** (4 cards):
  1. Total Channels + horizontal bar chart by category
  2. Cities with channels + concentration in top cities (bar chart)
  3. Channels in Recuperação Judicial → modal with all distress data
  4. Channels appearing in any news portal → modal with company / portal / publication date
- [ ] **Highlights**:
  - Companies in Recuperação Judicial (already done — `RiskSignals.tsx`)
  - Companies **expanding operations** — query Receita Federal (`crawlers.cnpj_estabelecimentos`) for recently opened CNPJs in agribusiness CNAEs by region
  - Companies mentioned in main news portals (NA, Agribiz, neofeed, Bloomberg Línea/agro, Globo Rural, etc.)
- [ ] **Per-company enrichment**:
  - Inpev cross-reference (defensive container recycling membership)
  - Google Maps Street View / Places photo of the POS
  - AgriSafe data imported from OneNote meeting files
  - Key persons, interests, meeting history, lead status
- [ ] **3-tier confidentiality model** enforced via the new `confidentiality` enum
- [ ] **Knowledge Base integration** — chat / RAG queries respect tier permissions
- [ ] **CRM workflow**: schedule meetings, find leads, push leads to **Central de Conteúdo** for newsletter / WhatsApp / email outreach

---

## Phase 25 — Marco Regulatório: Manual Inserts + Source CRUD

- [ ] Button to **upload a new law / regulation** (PDF or text) and add it to `regulatory_norms`
- [ ] Modal listing all main legal sources with CRUD
- [ ] When a norm is inserted, run an algorithmic CNAE classifier to populate `affected_companies`

---

## Phase 26 — Recuperação Judicial: Easier Backfilling + Debt Scraping

- [ ] **Easy CNPJ insertion** — paste a CNPJ, fetch Receita Federal, classify CNAE, insert into `recuperacao_judicial` if not present
- [ ] **Debt amount scraper** — for each RJ case, scrape the judicial process page (e-SAJ / TJ portals) OR run a DuckDuckGo / Google search and let an algorithmic regex pull "R$ X milhões" from snippets. LLM only as last-resort summarizer.
- [ ] Backfill the missing companies the user has flagged

---

## Phase 27 — Ingestão de Dados: Source CRUD + Usage Visibility

- [ ] CRUD for sources in the Source Registry UI
- [ ] **Usage map**: which Supabase tables each source feeds (visual graph)
- [ ] **Health tracking**: last successful fetch, error count, latency, sample row count
- [ ] Per-source enable/disable toggle (writes to `source_registry.active`)

---

## Phase 28 — Knowledge Architecture & RAG Foundation (carryover from old Phase 16)

- [x] 4-tier knowledge architecture (already enforced via `knowledge_items.tier`)
- [x] pgvector enabled
- [x] `news_knowledge` table with embeddings
- [x] Knowledge Base module with semantic search
- [x] Knowledge Mind Map visualization
- [ ] **MCP server** that exposes the knowledge base to Claude / GPT / other LLM agents
- [ ] **RAG endpoint** with confidentiality-tier-aware filtering
- [ ] Daily executive briefing generated from the knowledge base
- [ ] Anomaly narratives when MarketPulse detects rupture

---

## Phase 29 — AI Integration & Virtual Coworker (carryover from old Phase 17)

- [ ] OpenAI / Gemini / Claude content generation for first-draft articles from the topic pipeline
- [ ] Conversational chat interface (chat-style knowledge query) with RAG + tier permissions
- [ ] **Webapp version** of the entire app — same UI but web-only, with the chat panel always available
- [ ] Cron-driven LLM agents that scan news/events for entity mentions and enrich the knowledge base

---

## Phase 30 — Cross-Platform Intelligence & Polish

- [ ] Cross-reference RJ entities with Admin Portal via CNPJ
- [ ] Commodity exposure alerts in Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Market context panel when commercial team views a prospect
- [ ] Sentry error monitoring
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Ctrl+K command palette
- [ ] CSV/PDF export per module
- [ ] Institutional PDF export (executive briefing format)

## Strategic Vision

Market Hub is **not just a dashboard** — it is the knowledge engine of the AgriSafe ecosystem:

1. **Data is ingested** algorithmically from public sources (~166 catalogued, ~120 active) — **no LLM scraping**
2. **Knowledge is organized** around the 5 core entities (company, rural producer, farm, financial operation, ag-input transaction) and the 4 confidentiality tiers (public, agrisafe_published, agrisafe_confidential, client_confidential)
3. **Insights are generated** by cross-referencing entities (e.g. `v_retailers_in_rj` revealed R$ 582.6M of distressed channels in the Diretório)
4. **Content is created** — LinkedIn articles, campaigns, positioning — feeding back into the AgriSafe brand
5. **The brain is built** — RAG structure that becomes AgriSafe's digital twin, accessible via a webapp chat interface

The platform serves multiple AgriSafe products downstream:
- **Admin Portal** — credit risk, commercial intelligence
- **App Campo** — field sales agenda, client visits, calendar from Eventos Agro
- **Newsletter / WhatsApp outreach** — driven by Central de Conteúdo + CRM leads from Diretório de Canais
