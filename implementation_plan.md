## Vision

A continuously-running, bilingual (PT-BR/EN) public market intelligence platform for AgriSafe Tecnologia. The platform aggregates exclusively public data to support marketing campaigns, content creation, competitive analysis, and event planning for the Brazilian agribusiness sector.

### Hard Constraints
- ❌ **No proprietary data** — Never store, ingest, or reference confidential client data, financial records, HR data, or credentials
- ❌ **No OneNote data migration** — OneNote was audited read-only; no content is copied into the platform
- ✅ **Public data only** — All data flows sourced from public APIs, government databases, and open feeds

---

## Phase 1 — Research AgriSafe ✅

**Objective:** Map AgriSafe's full service/product offering, target market, and brand voice.

**Findings:**
- **Company:** AgriSafe Tecnologia LTDA (São Paulo, Brazil)
- **Core pillars:** Sales optimization, credit risk management, crop monitoring
- **Platform:** Analyzes 160+ attributes via agro-specific scoring algorithm
- **Clients:** Agricultural resellers (irrigation, fertilizers, inputs) and financial institutions
- **Products:** SaaS platform, mobile app, AgriAcordo partnership, blog
- **Website:** agrisafe.agr.br

## Phase 2 — Read-Only OneNote Audit ✅

**Objective:** Understand existing knowledge structure without making any changes.

**OneNote structure (AgriSafe notebook — 8 sections, ~80+ pages):**

| Section | Content Type | Data Sensitivity |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| General | Strategy, to-dos, Fiagro, market analysis, competitors, advisory board, LGPD | Mixed |
| SGT | Committee meetings, cedentes, NPL, StoneX migration | High |
| TI - Infra | System access, AWS, CERC, databases, platform configs | Critical |
| Comercial | Client relationship notes (ABC Banco, BTG, BB, BrasilAgro, Cosan...) | High |
| Marketing | Agencies, SEO, PR, website, competitors, B2C flows | Moderate |
| Investors | VC/partner notes, pitch materials, fundraising | Critical |
| HR | Candidate/employee profiles | Critical |
| Events | Conference notes (Google Cloud, Embrapa, NVIDIA, Agro ao Cubo...) | Low |

**Key insight:** The platform must run entirely parallel to OneNote, drawing zero proprietary data.

## Phase 3 — Architecture Design ✅

**5-module architecture approved:**

### Module 1: Agro Market Pulse
- Brazilian commodity prices (soy, corn, sugar, coffee, citrus, cotton)
- USD/BRL exchange rate, CEPEA indices
